**********ChangeLog : *****************
  - Search has been simplified for apex. Only one option and a physical cache is running in order to reduce the amount of time processing
  - Data Dictionnary function has been added and can be displayed with the shortcut : CTRL + F (It may take up to 1mn the first time but will run faster after)
  - Profiles functions have been partially rewritten to work more efficiently
  - Number of API calls is strongly reduced 
  - Control for deployment now contain a PageLayout comparison: Double clik on a layout diff to see a readable explanation of the difference
